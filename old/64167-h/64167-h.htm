<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>GUIDE TO
AMESBURY AND STONEHENGE.</h2>
<p>Leaving Salisbury by what is called the &ldquo;Upper
Road&rdquo; to Amesbury, one travels across a tract of bleak and
rather uninteresting downs.&nbsp; About two miles from Salisbury
(on the left) Old Sarum stands up conspicuously, and is the only
object of interest till one arrives at Amesbury, eight miles
distant from Salisbury.&nbsp; Amesbury calls itself a town, and
boasts of several shops and the telegraph.&nbsp; A railway
station is in process of construction.&nbsp; In Aubrey&rsquo;s
times Amesbury was celebrated for its tobacco pipes, marked with
a gauntlet, the name of the maker.&nbsp; Of these, several
specimens are to be found in the museum at Salisbury.</p>
<p>Returning to Salisbury from Amesbury, and taking &ldquo;the
Bourne&rdquo; route, there is a beautiful drive winding along the
banks of the Avon.&nbsp; I give a short account of the most
interesting places the traveller meets with on his homeward
journey.</p>
<h2>OLD SARUM.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Lies</span> two miles from Salisbury, and
stands up, making a bold outline in the surrounding open
country.&nbsp; It is a hill, bare now, save for some trees,
encircled with entrenchments, with a central mound peering above
them.&nbsp; But centuries ago this spot was crowded with
buildings&mdash;religious, military, and domestic, and was one of
the most important in our island.&nbsp; Some say that the ancient
British name was <i>Caer Sarflag</i>, <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>the &ldquo;City of the Service
Tree.&rdquo;&nbsp; Its Roman name was <i>Sorbiodunun</i>, the
Saxon <i>Sarobyrig</i>.&nbsp; The face of the hill is smooth and
very steep.&nbsp; The summit is fenced by a mighty earthen
rampart and ditch, protected by a lower raised bank outside of
it, the height from the top of the one to the bottom of the other
being 106 feet.&nbsp; The surface of the hill is an elongated
circular area of 27&frac12; acres.&nbsp; In the centre of the
area is a second circular earthwork and ditch 100 feet high, and
within these stood the citadel.&nbsp; On the top of the earthwork
surrounding the citadel was a very strong wall 12 feet thick, of
flint embedded in rubble, and coated with square stones, of which
some portion remain.&nbsp; To the great outer earthwork there
were two entrances&mdash;one (guarded by a hornwork still
remaining) on the western, another (the postern) on the eastern
side.&nbsp; The site of the citadel is now overgrown with briers
and brushwood; the rest of the area is partly in a state of
nature, partly cultivated.&nbsp; &ldquo;Celt and Roman alike had
seen the military value of the height from which the eye sweeps
nowadays over the grassy meadows of the Avon to the arrowy spire
of Salisbury; and, admirable as the position was in itself, it
had been strengthened at a vast cost of labour.&nbsp; The camp on
the summit of the knoll was girt in by a trench hewn so deeply in
the chalk that, from the inner side of it, the white face of the
rampart rose 100 feet high, while strong outworks protected the
approaches to the fortress from the west and from the
east.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though there may have been a British stronghold here, still,
it is the opinion of good antiquaries that there is now no
British work to be seen; that the Romans took possession of the
hill and defended it by a simple escarpment, without any ditch,
but with outworks at the entrances; and that the ditch now on the
face of the scarp, as well as the central citadel and its
defences, were added by the Saxons, and perhaps by Alfred, who,
in his war with the Danes, certainly paid great attention to
strengthening the position.&nbsp; There are Roman roads to
Silchester, Winchester, Dorchester, Uphill, on the Bristol
Channel, and others, it is believed, to Bath and
Marlborough.&nbsp; Cynric the Saxon won a victory over the
Britons in 552.&nbsp; In 960, Edgar held his Council here.&nbsp;
In 1003, Seweyn and the Danes are said to have stormed it.&nbsp;
In the time of the Confessor a monastery of nuns was <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>established.&nbsp; It was not till 1072 that it became
the seat of a bishop.&nbsp; The kingdom of Wessex originally
formed one diocese, and the see being fixed 683, St. H&aelig;dde
being bishop, the see was removed to Winchester.&nbsp; In 705,
the diocese was divided, a new see for the district of E. Selwood
being fixed at Sherborne, whose first bishop was St.
Ealdhelm.&nbsp; A further subdivision took place in 909, a new
see for Berks and Wilts being created at Ramsbury, which was
reunited to Sherborne by Bishop Herman 1045, who in 1072
transferred the see to Old Sarum.&nbsp; In 1070 William the
Conqueror, as the closing act of his conquest, reviewed his
victorious army on the plain below Old Sarum, where now the
modern city stands, rewarding its leaders with lands and
gifts.&nbsp; The Castellanship of Sarum he gave to his kinsman,
Osmund, who afterwards, taking Holy Orders, succeeded Herman in
the see.&nbsp; In 1086 the King assembled here, the year before
his death, all the chief landowners of the realm to swear that
&ldquo;whose men soever they were they would be faithful to him
against all other men,&rdquo; by which &ldquo;England was made
ever afterwards an undivided kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bishop Osmund finished his new cathedral in 1092, &ldquo;and
established the new ritual &lsquo;ad usum
Sarum.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; The foundations of the cathedral were
visible in the very dry summer of 1834.&nbsp; It was in the form
of a cross 270 feet long by 70 feet wide, the transept of the
same width and 150 feet long.&nbsp; Its plan is remarkable for
having a square instead of an apsidal East end, and a Galilee or
Atrium at the West end.&nbsp; Within a few days of its
consecration a thunderstorm seriously injured the roofs and
walls.&nbsp; Robert of Gloucester, alluding to the fifth year of
the reign of William II., sings:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;So gret lytnynge was the vyfte yer so that
al to noghte<br />
The rof of the Chyrch of Salesbury it bronte<br />
Rygh even the vyfte day that he y hawled was.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Henry the First&rsquo;s celebrated chancellor, Bishop Roger,
improved both the church and its fortifications.&nbsp; In the
reign of Stephen the place began to decline.&nbsp; The soldiers
and priests, cooped up into so small a space, could not
agree.&nbsp; The situation was cold and windy, and water was
scarce.&nbsp; Bishop Richard Poore is said to have been directed
in a vision to build upon the maer (or boundary) field, called <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>in some
accounts Miry-Field or the Merrifield, where a new church (the
present cathedral) was begun.&nbsp; The citizens migrated, the
great travelling road was diverted to the new site, and the days
of Old Sarum were numbered.&nbsp; A charter granted to the new
town sealed its fate.&nbsp; Very little, however, is known about
the real history of the transference of the people from one place
to the other.&nbsp; There are some reasons for believing that a
new town had been growing up by degrees long before the cathedral
was built at New Sarum.&nbsp; Being only 1600 feet in diameter,
Old Sarum must have afforded small space for a cathedral,
bishop&rsquo;s palace, a garrison, streets and houses.&nbsp; The
cathedral was taken down in 1331 (Edward III.), and its materials
used in building the new spire, Close Walls, &amp;c.&nbsp; Leland
(temp. Henry VIII.) reports some portions of the building as
visible in his time, but says: &ldquo;There is not one house
neither within or without Old Saresbyri inhabited.&nbsp; Much
notable ruinus building of the castell yet ther remaynith.&nbsp;
The ditch that envirined the old town was a very deepe and strong
thynge.&rdquo;&nbsp; The walls remained till 1608, and served as
a quarry.&nbsp; Fisherton old county jail (inter alia) was built
out of them.&nbsp; The great hollow enclosure of Old Sarum, girt
by its frowning earthwork (not unlike the crater of a volcano),
is certainly a solemn and desolate place.&nbsp; Pepys, passing
by, and not knowing what it was, desired to examine it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I saw a great fortification,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and
there light and to it and in it, and find it so prodigious so as
to frighten one to be in it all alone at that time of
night.&rdquo;&nbsp; A subterranean passage was discovered in
1795.&nbsp; The foundations of towers may be traced, and many
Roman coins have been met with.&nbsp; Old Salisbury has given a
title to the families of d&rsquo;Eureux or Devereux, Longespee,
Montacute, Nevill Plantagenet, and the Cecil family, who still
enjoy it.&nbsp; The ground ceased to be Crown property in 1447,
when it was granted by James I. to the Lords Stourton; on
forfeiture by them, it was granted by James I. to the
Cecils.&nbsp; They sold it to Governor Pitt, and the Earl of
Chatham sold it to the Earl of Caledon.&nbsp; It was subsequently
purchased by the Ecclesiastical Commission.&nbsp; Its dignity as
the resort of kings and seat of councils ceased with the growth
of the younger city; but it long retained one relic of its former
<a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>greatness,
the right of returning two members to Parliament, which was duly
exercised until the passing of the Reform Bill, although for many
a year only two or three cottages had existed.&nbsp; The
elections were held at the foot of the hill on Election Acre,
where a tent was pitched beneath the branches of an elm-tree,
which is still pointed out as occupying the site of the last
remaining house.</p>

<h2>STRATFORD-SUB-CASTLE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Lies</span> close under the hill of Old
Sarum, and derives its name from the Roman &ldquo;street&rdquo;
or road which here &ldquo;forded&rdquo; the river on its course
to Bradbury Rings and Dorchester.&nbsp; The manor house was the
residence of William Pitt, Earl of Chatham, who was first
returned to Parliament (1735) as member for those vacant mounds
on the hill above.&nbsp; Governor Pitt purchased the manor in
1690 for 1500<i>l.</i>, and Lord Grenville, who had married the
sister of Thomas Pitt, Lord Camelford, afterwards sold it for
65,000<i>l.</i> to Lord Caledon.&nbsp; In 1801 John Horne Tooke
was returned by Lord Camelford, and in his case the question of
the disability of clergymen to sit as Members of Parliament was
tried and settled.&nbsp; The doorhead of the quaint gabled
parsonage bears the inscription, &ldquo;Parva sed lapsa domino
1675.&rdquo;&nbsp; A charming lime avenue leads from the
parsonage to the church, which contains an hour glass stand for
the pulpit.</p>
<h2>THE CHURCH, AMESBURY.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Dedicated to
the Memories of St. Mary and St. Melorus</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the finest in
Wiltshire.&nbsp; A fourteenth century nave roof covers a Norman
nave, and a thirteenth century chapel possesses a beautiful
window, with two lights, and slender delicate column and
sculptured leafy cap.&nbsp; Arch&aelig;ologists <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>dispute as to
whether this is the abbey church (a Benedictine order founded by
Queen Elfrida to expiate the murder of her step-son at Corfe) or
merely the parish church.&nbsp; I consider that there can be
<i>no</i> doubt that it is the abbey church, and in my next
edition I hope this fact will be proved from excavations to be
made under the superintendence of Mr. Detmar Blow, the architect
for the structural repairs that are, unfortunately, necessary,
the four angles of the church tower and the voussoirs of the arch
having become separated, &amp;c.&nbsp; Only 1400<i>l.</i> is
needed, and subscriptions will be gratefully acknowledged by the
Manager of the Wilts and Dorset Bank, Amesbury, Wilts; or Lady
Antrobus, Amesbury Abbey.&nbsp; An unfortunate
&ldquo;restoration&rdquo; was made in 1853, which swept away the
furnishings of the Early Romantic period.</p>

<h2>AMESBURY ABBEY.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Salisbury</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> writing the above little note
on Amesbury church, the necessary repairs to the tower have been
most sympathetically carried out by Mr. Detmar Blow.&nbsp; No
changes are to be noticed from the exterior&mdash;the test of a
good architect&rsquo;s work applied to old buildings.&nbsp; The
underpinning disclosed the remains of a Saxon pillar embedded in
the masonry of the nave wall&mdash;may not this fact go to prove
that the present building stands on the site of Elfrida&rsquo;s
church?&nbsp; At the completion of Mr. Blow&rsquo;s work, which
includes the underpinning of the tower, repairs to the nave, and
the rehanging of the bells, further repairs were found to be
necessary.&nbsp; The Rev. F. Windley (the new vicar) held a
meeting, dismissing Mr. Blow and appointing Mr. Warre as
architect in his place, with most unfortunate results.&nbsp; The
roof of the exquisite little chapel has been removed and altered
to a higher pitch, inferior flint work used, and crude yellow
stones instead of the beautiful silvery-grey old coping.&nbsp;
This act of vandalism was done against the wishes of the Society
for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, and my own.&nbsp; No
&ldquo;restorations&rdquo; (so called) should ever be allowed <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>for these
buildings, only &ldquo;repairs.&rdquo;&nbsp; The pitch of the old
roof should not have been altered, even if originally higher, as,
so to speak, the whole thing had grown together; also nothing but
old stones for coping should have been used, and grey flints
instead of black ones.&nbsp; It is extraordinary to see the
damage done to the rare and beautiful buildings in this
neighbourhood.&nbsp; Yellow stones, hideous in colour, put in
with still more hideous plaster, is the local idea of suitable
&ldquo;restoration.&rdquo;&nbsp; The vandal architect Butterfield
buried (in 1853) under the chancel the memorial tablets, at the
same time breaking up the lovely old font and burying its
remains.&nbsp; This latter has been beautifully mended by Mr.
Kite, builder.&nbsp; The memorial tablets, some very beautiful,
have not yet been rehung, as they should be, in the body of the
church.</p>

<p>I was requested to give a cross for the altar.&nbsp; I had a
copy made of the celebrated Celtic &ldquo;Cross of
Cong.&rdquo;&nbsp; I also presented an altar-cloth of old crimson
Italian damask (from Florence).&nbsp; A dove, embroidered in
different tones of gold and silver thread, decorates the
frontal.&nbsp; Mr. Windley thought fit to cut and alter this
altar-cloth, adding an unsuitable top and fringe, and spoiling
the effect of the chancel by covering the pink alabaster with
cheap, ugly, woven materials.&nbsp; The effect of the delicate
lines of the Celtic cross and the crimson damask are by this
treatment utterly ruined.</p>

<h2>AMESBURY ABBEY: ITS HISTORY, ANCIENT AND MODERN.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> river Avon, on its course to
the sea, passes through a beautiful, thickly wooded valley in
Wiltshire, in which lies Amesbury, or, to follow the old
spelling, Ambresbury, signifying the land of Ambrosius.&nbsp;
This fascinating place, and the wild country surrounding it,
possess a charm and <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>beauty all their own, and those born and bred there ever
pine for the breezy downs, as the Swiss for their mountains or
north-country people for the moorland; and no one who has walked
or ridden on some glorious summer morning over the fine, close
grass clothing these Wiltshire downs can ever forget its
delicious &ldquo;springy&rdquo; quality underfoot.&nbsp; A
talented modern artist once happily christened Amesbury
&ldquo;The Golden Valley;&rdquo; he saw it in the spring, at
which season of the year the whole country-side seems ablaze with
brilliant yellow flowers.</p>

<p>Amesbury lies eight miles north of Salisbury, and we may
consider that it occupies a space in the midst of that vast tract
of undulating country that (somewhat erroneously to my mind) is
given the name of &ldquo;Salisbury Plain.&rdquo;&nbsp; I now
propose to trace, as briefly as I can, some of the history of
this interesting and beautiful place.&nbsp; Its antiquity is so
great as to take us back to pre-historic times.&nbsp; In its near
neighbourhood many desperate battles were fought between Briton,
Saxon, and Roman with varying success.&nbsp; Lewis, in his
ancient <i>History of Britain</i>, says: &ldquo;In the reign of
Vortigern, 461 <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>, a Conference
was appointed to take place near the Abbey of Ambri, with Hengist
the Saxon, and it was agreed that both parties should come
without armour.&nbsp; But Hengist, under colour of peace, devised
the subversion of all the nobility of Britain, and chose out to
come to this assembly his faithfullest and hardiest men,
commanding every one of them to hide under their garment a long
knife, with which, when he should give the watchword, every one
should kill the Briton next him.&nbsp; Both sides met upon the
day appointed, and, treating earnestly upon the matter, Hengist
suddenly gave the watchword and caught Vortigern by the collar,
upon which the Saxons, with their long knives, violently murdered
the innocent and unarmed Britons.&nbsp; Thus were 460 earls and
noblemen of the Britons treacherously murdered.&nbsp; They were
buried in the convent at Amesbury.&nbsp; This massacre took place
near Stonehenge, where repeated battles were fought between
Ambrosius and Hengist.&rdquo; <a name="citation10"></a><a
href="#footnote10" class="citation">[10]</a></p>
<p><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>There
is a fanciful legend, told by an old writer called Geoffrey of
Monmouth, about Stonehenge.&nbsp; He says that Ambrosius, wishing
to commemorate those who had fallen in battle, thought fit to
send for Merlin the Wizard, to consult him on the proper monument
to be erected to the memory of the slain.&nbsp; On being
interrogated Merlin replied, &ldquo;Send for the
&lsquo;Giants&rsquo; Dance,&rsquo; which is in Killarus
(Kildare), a mountain in Ireland; they are stones of a vast
magnitude, and if they can be placed here quite round this spot
of ground they will stand <i>for ever</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; At these
words Aurelius laughed and said, &ldquo;How was it possible to
remove such stones from so distant a country, and had not Britain
as good stones?&rdquo;&nbsp; Merlin replied &ldquo;that they were
mystical stones and had a medicinal virtue,&rdquo; whereupon the
Britons resolved to send for them and to risk a battle.&nbsp;
Upon landing in Ireland, the removal of the stones was violently
opposed by Gillomanius, a youth of wonderful valour.&nbsp; At the
head of a vast army, he exclaimed, &ldquo;While I have life they
shall not take from us the least stone of the Giants&rsquo;
Dance.&rdquo;&nbsp; A battle ensued, which was won by the
Britons.&nbsp; They then proceeded to Killarus, where the sight
of the stones filled them with joy and admiration, and, while
they were all standing round, Merlin asked them to try and remove
the stones.&nbsp; Their efforts proving futile, he laughingly
proceeded with his own contrivances, and took down the stones
with incredible facility.&nbsp; This done, they set sail to
Britain, and repaired to the burial-place with the stones,
Aurelius ordering Merlin to get them up in the same manner as
they had been in the mountain of Killarus, which he accordingly
did.</p>
<p>Queen Elfrida, who performed many penances and built
monasteries in atonement for the crime of the murder of her
step-son, Edward the Martyr, founded a Benedictine nunnery at
Amesbury in 980.&nbsp; This nunnery flourished for many years,
until the ill-conduct of the nuns caused King Henry II. to expel
them (1177), and place them under stricter discipline in other
religious houses.&nbsp; He then gave the monastery of Ambresbury
to the Abbey of Fontevrault, in Normandy.&nbsp; This order was
founded by Robert d&rsquo;Arbrissel about the end of the eleventh
century.&nbsp; It is looked upon as a singularity in the church,
some finding it <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>strange to see an abbess exercising equal authority over
men as well as women.&nbsp; Before his death d&rsquo;Arbrissel
appointed Petronilla de Craou Chemille as head and chief of his
order, of which he drew up statutes, putting them under the order
of St. Benedict.&nbsp; Under the new rule, this monastery
increased in splendour and royal favour, King John conferring
upon it important privileges.&nbsp; Eleanor, only daughter of
Geoffrey, Earl of Bretagne, was buried, according to her own
request, at Ambresbury in 1241.&nbsp; Mary, sixth daughter of
Edward I., together with thirteen young ladies of royal birth,
took the veil in 1283; and two years afterwards, anno 1287,
Eleanor, queen of Henry III., entered the order, and died and was
buried at Ambresbury in 1292.&nbsp; The monastery continued to
prosper, and became one of the richest in England.&nbsp; The
following names of the prioresses have been
preserved:&mdash;Isabella of Lancaster, fourth daughter of Henry,
Earl of Lancaster; Joan de Gennes; Sibilla de Montacute;
Katherine of Arragon lodged within the convent walls on her first
arrival in England in 1501.</p>

<p>At the time of the Reformation, the last prioress (but one),
Florence Bormewe, refused to surrender her monastery to the
King&rsquo;s emissaries.&nbsp; They wrote: &ldquo;Albeit we have
used as many ways with her as our poor wits could attain, yet in
the end we could not by any persuasion bring her to any
conformity, but at all times she resteth and so remaineth in
these terms.&rdquo;&nbsp; She answered, &ldquo;If the
King&rsquo;s Highness command me to go from this house I will
gladly go, though I beg my bread, and as for pension I care for
none.&rdquo;&nbsp; The death of this brave prioress saved her
from further humiliation.</p>
<p>Joan Darell was abbess at the time of the Dissolution; she
surrendered to King Henry VIII. Dec. 4th, 1540.</p>
<p>The old Chronicle of Geoffrey of Monmouth gives Amesbury as
the place of Queen Guinevere&rsquo;s penitential
retirement.&nbsp; The modern poet, Tennyson, takes the same
view:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Queen Guinevere had fled the Court and
sat<br />
There in the holy house at Almesbury.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Antiquarians disagree as to whether the fine church now <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>standing&mdash;with its lancet windows, pointed arches,
and massive turret&mdash;is the old abbey church, or only that of
the parish.&nbsp; In an obscure corner at the back of the church
is found a window of quite another description&mdash;very
beautiful, and more approaching to the &ldquo;rose&rdquo; style
of architecture.&nbsp; Of the old stained glass only a few broken
fragments remain.&nbsp; On one piece is a picture of a
fair-haired, long-necked woman suppose to represent Queen
Guinevere.</p>
<p>The churchyard (lying to the south of the old church), with
its grey tombstones and dark green yew-trees, has a solemn, calm
and peaceful air.&nbsp; Over a grave is found the following
epitaph:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Altho&rsquo; his body here doth lye<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till the last trump doth it raise,<br />
His soul is now in heaven high<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sings Jehovah&rsquo;s praise.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I now finish my description of Amesbury&rsquo;s monastic
period and turn to the modern years.&nbsp; According to a good
authority, Henry VIII. bestowed Amesbury upon Edward, Earl of
Hertford, afterwards Duke of Somerset and Lord Protector in the
succeeding reign.&nbsp; After his trial, death sentence, and
execution, the lands were confiscated by the Crown till the reign
of Queen Elizabeth, who probably restored them to the
Protector&rsquo;s son, Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford.&nbsp;
This gentleman was thrice married, his last wife being a widow of
fascinating beauty and charm.&nbsp; She had previously been
engaged to Sir George Rodney, who loved her madly, but, being
ambitious, she left him for Lord Hertford.&nbsp; The day before
the marriage, Sir George Rodney travelled to the inn at Amesbury
and waited for the home-coming of the bride and bridegroom.&nbsp;
All the night he occupied himself by composing a dying love song
written with his own blood.&nbsp; Upon the arrival in the village
of his false love, he went to greet her, and fell upon his sword
and expired at her feet.&nbsp; I give the following extract from
the poem, which is somewhat long and tedious:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>&ldquo;Sir George Rodney before he killed
himself&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What shall I do that am undone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where shall I fly myself to shunne?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah mee! myselfe must kill,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet I die against my will.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In starry letters I behold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My death in the Heavens enrolled.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There finde it wrytt in skyes above<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That I (poore I) must die for love.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas not my love deserved to die,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O no! it was unworthy I.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I for her love should not have dyde,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But that I had no worth beside.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah mee! that love such woe procures,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For without her no love endures.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I for her vertues her doe serve,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Doth such a love a death deserve?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lady Hertford presented a bell to the parish of
Amesbury.&nbsp; An inscription on it runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Be stronge in faythe, prayes God well.<br
/>
Frances, Countess Hertford&rsquo;s bell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the Seymour period, the Amesbury estates passed through
different hands, belonging in 1720 to Henry, Lord Carleton; he
having purchased them from Charles, Lord Bruce, son of the Earl
of Ailesbury.&nbsp; Lord Carleton left them by will to his
nephew, Charles, Duke of Queensberry, in 1724, who married the
charming Lady Catherine Hyde in 1720.&nbsp; This couple spent
much time at Amesbury, altering and improving it in various ways,
and entertaining their friends.</p>
<p>The poet Gay was a devoted friend and admirer of the Duchess,
who, indeed, seems to have been an attractive woman of immense
spirit and wit.&nbsp; She offended George II. and his Queen by
her defence of Gay&rsquo;s play, the <i>Beggars&rsquo; Opera</i>,
and was forbidden the Court for some time; but she, standing
firmly by her friend, refused to retract or alter her sentiments,
and finally forced the Court to receive and forgive her.&nbsp;
Here is a copy of her message to the King:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>&ldquo;<i>Feb.</i> 27<i>th</i>, 1729.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That the Duchess of Queensberry is surprised and well
pleased the King has given her so agreeable a command as to stay
from Court, where she never came for diversion, but to bestow a
civility upon the King and Queen.&nbsp; She hopes, by such an
unprecedented order as this, that the King will see as few as he
wishes at his Court, particularly such as dare to think or speak
truth.&nbsp; I dare not do otherwise, and ought not nor could not
have imagin&rsquo;d that it would not have been the very highest
compliment that I could possibly pay the King, to endeavour to
support truth and innocence in this house.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">(Signed) &ldquo;C. <span
class="smcap">Queensberry</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following is an extract from a letter from Gay to
Swift:&mdash;&ldquo;To the lady I live with I owe my life and
fortune; think of her with respect, value and esteem her as I
do.&nbsp; She hath so much goodness, virtue, and generosity, that
if you knew her you would have a pleasure in obeying her as I
do.&rdquo;&nbsp; In another letter from Gay to Swift, the former
presses his coming to join the party at Amesbury, saying
(speaking of the Duchess):&mdash;&ldquo;I think her so often in
the right, you will have great difficulties to persuade me she is
in the wrong.&nbsp; The lady of the house is not given to show
civility to those she does not like.&nbsp; She speaks her mind
and loves truth, for the uncommonness of the thing.&nbsp; I fancy
your curiosity will prevail over your fear, and you will like to
see such a woman.&nbsp; But I say no more till I know whether her
Grace will fill up the rest of the paper.&rdquo;&nbsp; P.S. by
the Duchess: &ldquo;Write I must, particularly now, as I have an
opportunity to indulge my predominant passion of
Contradiction.&nbsp; I do, in the first place, contradict most
things Mr. Gay says of me to deter you from coming here, which,
if ever you do, I hereby assure you that, unless I like my own
way better, you shall have yours; and in all disputes you shall
convince me if you can.&nbsp; But, by what I see of you, this is
not a misfortune that will always happen, for I find you a great
mistaker.&nbsp; For example, you take prudence for
imperiousness.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis from this I first determined not
to like one who is too giddy-headed for me to be certain whether
or no I shall ever be acquainted with him.&nbsp; I have known
people take great delight in building castles <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>in the air;
but I should choose to build friendship on a more solid
foundation.&nbsp; I would fain know you, for I often hear more
likeable things than &rsquo;tis possible any one can
deserve.&nbsp; Pray come that I may find out something wrong, for
I, and I believe most women, have an inconceivable pleasure to
find out any faults except their own.&rdquo;&nbsp;
P.S.&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Gay is very peevish that I spell and write
ill, but I don&rsquo;t care, for neither the pen nor I can do
better!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This Duchess also attracted the attention of Prior, who wrote
the well-known ballad:&mdash;</p>
<h3>THE FEMALE PHAETON.</h3>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">I.</p>
<p>Thus Kitty beautiful and young,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And wild as colt untam&rsquo;d,<br />

<p>This lady&rsquo;s luck and happiness appear to vanish in later
life, both her sons meeting tragic deaths; the eldest, Viscount
Drumlanrig, shooting himself, the second, Lord Charles Douglas,
dying of consumption at Amesbury, having just escaped the perils
of the great earthquake at Lisbon.</p>
<p>The Duchess died July 19th, 1777, aged 77, and the Duke the
following year.</p>
<p>The title of Duke of Queensberry descended to the Duke&rsquo;s
cousin, William, Earl of March and Raglin.&nbsp; In 1778 he
succeeded his cousin Charles as 4th Duke of Queensberry, and in
1786 was created a British peer, taking the title of Baron
Douglas of Ambresbury.&nbsp; This eccentric nobleman never
married, and was commonly known by the nickname of &ldquo;Old
Q.&rdquo;&nbsp; He died in 1810, the Amesbury estate passing <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>to Archibald,
Lord Douglas of Douglas, whose executors sold it in 1824 to Sir
Edmund Antrobus, Bart., my husband&rsquo;s great-great-uncle.</p>
<p>No record is to be found of the destruction of the Abbey, Lord
Hertford apparently building himself a house in Amesbury.&nbsp;
In &ldquo;Vitruvius Britannicus&rdquo; there is a picture of a
fine mansion in the Palladian style, built for Lord Carleton from
designs by Inigo Jones, the architect being Mr. Webb, nephew of
Inigo Jones.</p>
<p>The Queensberrys added wings to this house, and caused a
beautiful bridge to span the river Avon, which runs through the
grounds.&nbsp; A pretty old house stands in the park, near an old
entrance: tradition tells us the Duchess of Queensberry used this
lodge as a dairy.&nbsp; It possesses two octagon rooms (one over
the other), and an underground passage is supposed to connect it
with the river.&nbsp; The park is small, but extremely pretty;
one enters it through splendid old gates supported by Palladian
pillars.</p>
<p>Opposite the dwelling house is a high bank cut into a
fantastic shape and known as &ldquo;The Diamond.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
cave in which the poet Gay loved to write is hollowed in this
bank.&nbsp; The wild-bird-frequented Avon <a
name="citation18"></a><a href="#footnote18"
class="citation">[18]</a> runs below, and above it is crowned by
a beautiful wood planted over what is called
&ldquo;Vespasian&rsquo;s Camp.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this wood are
found two avenues of beech-trees, and walking through the old
deer park and across the Downs, at a mile and a half&rsquo;s
distance, glorious Stonehenge bursts upon one.</p>
<p>Returning to Amesbury, and following the course of the river
in the opposite direction, one comes upon a little house built of
flints, with quaint pointed roof and tower, in which the floor of
a small upper chamber is found to be movable; outside, over a
door, the stone moulding bears this inscription:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Diana, her hovs&mdash;1600.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Diana certainly possessed a picturesque dwelling, but I can
find no clue to her identity.&nbsp; After the death of the last
<a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>Duke of
Queensberry, Amesbury House remained uninhabited for sixty years,
except during the tenancy of Sir Elijah Impey, and when some
French nuns occupied it for a short period.</p>
<p>My husband&rsquo;s grandfather, on inheriting Amesbury from
his uncle (the first Sir Edmund Antrobus), wished to enlarge and
restore the old house, but finding it in too dilapidated a state,
decided to pull it down, and in 1838 began to build an entirely
new house (closely resembling the old one) of handsome cut stone,
with a grand loggia, supported by beautiful pillars and
ornamented with carved stonework of fine design.&nbsp; This house
is supposed to stand on the site of the old Abbey, and many
traces of cells were discovered, underground, when digging
foundations.&nbsp; To-day not a single stone of the old Abbey
remains above ground to remind us of its former existence and
splendour; it having once covered, tradition says, a space of
thirteen acres.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>.&mdash;Some beautiful coloured
tiles decorated with different intricate patterns were dug up
near the present house at Amesbury.&nbsp; We suppose them to be
from the cells of the old Abbey.&nbsp; Some have designs of the
<i>Fleur-de-lys</i> on them.</p>
<h2>PRICELESS STONEHENGE&mdash;SOME IMPRESSIONS.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">(From <i>Ladies&rsquo; Realm</i>
Magazine.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Great Druidical Temple, or (as
some hold) Ph&oelig;nician Observatory, composed of gigantic,
beautifully-coloured, hewn stones, stands in the middle of
Salisbury Plain.&nbsp; These stones have been measured, counted,
defaced, praised, depreciated, commented upon, by numerous
authorities on countless occasions, but (to my knowledge) no
account of their poetical and picturesque aspects, at different
seasons of the year, has been attempted.&nbsp; I shall feel
satisfied if I succeed in conveying feebly in words what David
Cox (the artist) did ably in colours, with his glowing
brush.&nbsp; I do not propose to enter into any statistics, as to
the &ldquo;Market value of Stonehenge to the nation,&rdquo; or to
tell you the number of <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>miles that lie between it and the
town of Salisbury, the goodness or inferiority of the roads to
it, the number of visiting tourists, &amp;c.; I only wish to
place before you some impressions I have felt of its grandeur and
charm, through many seasons, in all sorts of weather, and varying
moods.</p>
<p>There is always a constant surprise and delight to me in the
manner in which Stonehenge bursts upon one, approach it as one
may, from various points across the undulating Plain which
surrounds it.&nbsp; Starting upon one&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Path&rdquo; to visit it, from any side, at
first there is nothing to be seen but the crisp crackling grass
underfoot, and the white glittering roads; then, as one advances
nearer, unexpectedly, dark, mysterious forms seem to start up,
which gradually shape themselves into the incompleted circle we
call &ldquo;Stonehenge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The late spring, and early summer, are enchanting periods;
myriads of starry white flowers, and gorgeous yellow and blue
ones, wave together with a glowing harmony of colour, as they are
swayed by soft breezes, whilst a &ldquo;Hallelujah Chorus&rdquo;
of skylarks sing overhead, making the air full of scent and
sound.&nbsp; In this setting, the old stones seem all yellow and
grey in the brilliant sunshine.&nbsp; Picturesque shepherds,
wrapped in their great dark-blue cloaks, appear upon the horizon;
tinkling sheep bells are heard, reminding one of the Roman
Campagna; evening falling, brings a sense of peace and stillness,
chimes from the old Church at Amesbury float across the
valley.&nbsp; The light comes and goes, and the world seems far
away.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>To my mind the magic of Stonehenge is never more powerfully
felt than during the wild, tempestuous autumnal gales, that
usually sweep across the Plain in October.&nbsp; Great clouds
roll above, enfolding the circle in a shadowy purple mantle,
sometimes tipped with gold.&nbsp; Thoughts rise up suddenly, of
the many tragedies, feasts, sacrifices, mysterious rites that
must have been enacted here in far-off bygone days.&nbsp; One
wonders if beautiful golden-haired Guinevere passed this way, on
her flight to safety, at the Convent at &ldquo;Ambresbury&rdquo;
(the Land of Ambrosius), or if sad King Arthur tarried there on
his lonely homeward journey?</p>
<p><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>I
prefer to picture to myself, Stonehenge, in happy, thoughtless
Pagan days, Druid priests and priestesses forming grand
processions; crossing the &ldquo;rushing Avon&rdquo; and winding
up from the valley to Stonehenge, clothed in pure white, and
holding gleaming sickles in their hands, chanting hymns on their
way to perform the sacred rite of cutting the mistletoe.&nbsp;
Perhaps they sang and chanted through the short summer night,
waiting for the sun to rise (over the pointed outlying stone) on
the day which marks the solar half-year (June 21st), and which
bathes the altar-stone in golden light.&nbsp; Probably this was
the signal for sacrifice, the death of the victim, and the
appeasing of wrathful gods.&nbsp; In mid-winter the stones appear
like black masses, in the midst of driving snows.&nbsp; The least
interesting time of year, in this enchanted place, is the bright,
clear, commonplace summer, when no mysteries abound (except by
moonlight).&nbsp; The old gods are sleeping, everything is
orderly, agriculture and its implements surround us, and Romance
seems dead for the moment.&nbsp; Farewell.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Florence

<p>In approaching&rsquo; the momentous and deeply interesting
subject of Stonehenge, I considered it best and wisest to collect
the thoughts and opinions of several learned authors on this
subject, and submit them to the reader, who thus will have an
opportunity of comparing for himself the truth and merits of the
different theories presented to him for judgment.</p>
<p>Various explanations of the name &ldquo;Stonehenge&rdquo; have
been forthcoming; but the true etymological significance seems to
be: A.S. &ldquo;St&agrave;n,&rdquo; used as an adjective, and
&ldquo;henge,&rdquo; from A.S. &ldquo;h&ograve;n&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i>, stone hanging-places, from the groups of stones
resembling a gallows.&nbsp; This was long ago suggested by Wace,
the Anglo-Norman poet, who writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Stanhengues ont nom en Englois<br />
Pierres pendues en Fran&ccedil;ois.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As to the date of Stonehenge, opinions vary.&nbsp; It is
supposed Hecat&aelig;us (500 <span class="GutSmall">B.C.</span>)
mentioned it as the &ldquo;Round <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>Temple&rdquo; (Translation of Extract
from Diodorus Siculus, about <span class="GutSmall">B.C.</span>
8).</p>
<p>Hecat&aelig;us, the Milesian, and others, have handed down to
us the following story:&mdash;&ldquo;Over against Gaul, in the
great ocean stream, is an island not less in extent than Sicily,
stretching towards the north.&nbsp; The inhabitants are called
Hyperboreans, because their abode is more remote from us than
that wind we call Boreas.&nbsp; It is said that the soil is very
rich and fruitful, and the climate so favourable that there are
two harvests in every year.&nbsp; Their fables say that Latona
was born in this island, and on that account they worship Apollo
(Apollo would signify the sun to the Latins) before all other
divinities, and celebrate his praise in daily hymns, conferring
the highest honours upon their bards, as being his priests.&nbsp;
There is in this island a magnificent temple to this god,
circular in form, and adorned with many splendid offerings.&nbsp;
And there is also a city sacred to Apollo, inhabited principally
by harpers, who in his temple sing sacred verses to the god,
accompanied by the harp, in honour of his deeds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The language of the Hyperboreans is peculiar, and they
are singularly well affected towards the Greeks, and have been so
from the most remote times, especially to those of Athens and
Delos.&nbsp; It is even said that some Greeks have travelled
thither, and presented offerings at their temple inscribed with
Grecian characters.&nbsp; They also say that Abaris in former
times went thence to Greece, to renew their ancient friendship
with the Delians.&nbsp; It is related, moreover, that in this
island the moon appears but a short way from the earth, and to
have little hills upon it.&nbsp; Once in nineteen years (and this
period is what we call the Great Year) they say that their god
visits the island; and from the Vernal Equinox to the rising of
the Pleiades, all the night through, expresses his satisfaction
at his own exploits by dances and by playing on the harp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both the City and the Temple are presided over by the
Boread&oelig;, the descendants of Boreas, and they hand down the
power in regular succession in their family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first author who is considered to make unmistakable
mention of Stonehenge is Henry of Huntingdon (twelfth
century).&nbsp; In his Chronicle he speaks of it as the second <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>wonder of
England, and calls it Stanenges.&nbsp; Geoffrey of Monmouth
(1138) wrote of it about the same time; he believed it to have
been erected by Aurelius Ambrosius, King of Britain, and called
it Hengist&rsquo;s Stones.&nbsp; Giraldus Cambrensis, a
contemporary of Geoffrey, also makes mention of it.</p>
<p>Among more modern authors, may be quoted Sir Philip
Sidney&rsquo;s lines:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Near Wilton sweet, huge heaps of stones are
found,<br />
But so confused that neither any eye<br />
Can count them first, nor reason try<br />
What force them brought to so unlikely ground.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Wharton&rsquo;s sonnet:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thou noblest monument of Albion&rsquo;s
isle!<br />
Whether by Merlin&rsquo;s aid from Scythia&rsquo;s shore<br />
To Amber&rsquo;s fatal plain Pendragon bore,<br />
Huge frame of giant hands, the mighty pile,<br />
To entomb his Britain&rsquo;s slain by Hengist&rsquo;s guile;<br
/>
Or Druid priests, sprinkled with human gore,<br />
Taught &rsquo;mid thy massy maze their mystic lore;<br />
Or Danish chiefs, enriched with savage spoil,<br />
To victory&rsquo;s idle vast, an unhewn shrine,<br />
Reared the rude heap; or in thy hallowed round<br />
Repose the kings of Brutus&rsquo; genuine line;<br />
Or here those kings in solemn state were crowned<br />
Studious to trace thy wondrous origin,<br />
We muse on many an ancient tale renowned.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To descend to prose.&nbsp; Langtoft, in his Chronicle,
says:&mdash;&ldquo;A wander wit of Wiltshire, rambling to Rome,
to gaze at antiquities, and there screwing himself into the
company of antiquarians, they entreated him to illustrate unto
them that famous monument in his country called Stonage.&nbsp;
His answer was that he had never seen it.&nbsp; Whereupon they
kicked him out of doors, and bade him go home and see
Stonage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The immortal Pepys says the stones are &ldquo;as prodigious as
<a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>any tales
I have ever heard of them, and worth going this journey to
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The arch&aelig;ologist, Mr. Edmund Story Maskelyne, fixes the
date of Stonehenge at 900 or 1000 <span
class="GutSmall">B.C.</span>&nbsp; I quote what he says from a
lecture, read 1897, &ldquo;On the Age and Purpose of
Stonehenge&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is of consequence that we should
recognize that Stonehenge was built about nine or ten hundred
years <span class="GutSmall">B.C.</span>, and not 700 <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>, as many writers would have us
believe.&nbsp; For instance, Dr. W. M. Flinders Petrie, in his
book, &lsquo;Stonehenge, 1880,&rsquo; states his opinion that it
was erected <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 700&#177;200, that
is, between <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 500 and 900.&nbsp;
The date of Stonehenge will be of great interest if there is
found at Avebury remains sufficiently perfect to determine
astronomically the date when that monument was erected.&nbsp; For
it cannot be but interesting to ascertain when the two
cults&mdash;that of the sun, pure and simple, as exemplified in
the original Temple at Stonehenge; and the cult of the sun in
connexion with the serpent, as exhibited at
Avebury&mdash;respectively prevailed in this country.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Story Maskelyne&rsquo;s reasons for his theory that
Stonehenge was built by the Ph&oelig;nicians are as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I should like to add some reasons for my
belief that Stonehenge was built by the Ph&oelig;nicians.&nbsp;
In the first place, I cannot think of any other people that could
have either designed or executed such a monument, which required
both science for its conception and skill for its erection.&nbsp;
The Ph&oelig;nicians, with their perfect familiarity with masts,
and cordage, and pulleys, could easily lift the imposts, of which
the largest&mdash;being about 11 ft. long, 4 or 6 wide, and 3 ft.
thick&mdash;would weigh less than ten tons; and the
Ph&oelig;nicians must have known how the Egyptians raised masses
of stone many times heavier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trilithon <a name="citation24"></a><a
href="#footnote24" class="citation">[24]</a> standing clear seems
to have had some fascination for these people.&nbsp; They are
found still standing in Tripoli in Libya, as described in
&lsquo;The Hill of the Graces,&rsquo; a record of investigation
among the Trilithons and Megalithic sites of Tripoli by Mr.
Cowper, F.S.A., 1897, and specimens <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>exist on the Continent of Europe, in
Normandy and in Brittany.&nbsp; One may be seen in the Island of
Ushant, and another in St. Nazaire on the probable route they
adopted for the passage of tin.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

title=
"Great Circle and Leaning Stone, as it was&mdash;now upright"
 src="images/p24s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Another peculiarity can be seen to this day by any one
at Stonehenge in the large trilithon impost, namely, that the
under surfaces of the imposts which rested on the uprights are
smoothly cut and slightly bevelled, so as to throw the principal
weight of the mass of the impost on its outside edge, thus
excluding rain, &amp;c., and this very contrivance was employed
by the Egyptians in the pyramids, and it is certain that the
Ph&oelig;nicians had free intercourse with Egypt.&nbsp; Finally,
the Ph&oelig;nicians had founded Cadiz, their Gadir in the
eleventh century <span class="GutSmall">B.C.</span>, more than
two centuries before the date which, from astronomical
considerations, I assign for the building of Stonehenge.&nbsp; We
know that they sailed along the shores of Spain and Gaul and to
the Baltic, and though they preferred coasting as a rule, the
straight cut across from Cherbourg to Poole or Christchurch in
fine weather would not be a long voyage; and as they certainly
did trade with Britain, and it must have been hazardous for
British coracles to sail across the open sea, laden with tin, we
may conclude that Ph&oelig;nician ships did cross the
Channel.&nbsp; We know also that the Ph&oelig;nicians made, more
or less, homes for themselves wherever they landed; and it is
probable that they did so at Poole or Christchurch, also that
they would build them a temple where they found it convenient to
stay.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Story Maskelyne considers the Greeks reformed the Temple
later on.&nbsp; &ldquo;Within 500 years of the latest of the
above-mentioned dates the Ph&oelig;nician or Tyrian Empire had
ceased to exist, and her numerous colonies had been absorbed by
the nationalities surrounding them.&nbsp; About <span
class="GutSmall">B.C.</span> 400 the Greeks supplanted the
Ph&oelig;nicians in their trade with Britain, and probably for
some time continued to use the same mart and sea route the latter
had used&mdash;we may assume from Cherbourg to Poole or
Christchurch, whence they bore away the tin in their coracles
from Cornwall.&nbsp; Now commenced a new era for
Stonehenge.&nbsp; It must have been a noted Temple, and I cannot
doubt that Hecat&aelig;us did allude to it as cited by Strabo,
when he <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>wrote, in the sixth century <span
class="GutSmall">B.C.</span>, of the Round Temple to Apollo in
the land of the Hyperboreans.&nbsp; Now the festivals of the
Greeks were more connected with the months than with the year,
and their calendar months were alternate, full and hollow, where
the thirty pillars were doubtless used by them for the daily
sacrifice in the months of thirty days and the spaces between
them, omitting the entrance, for the hollow months, of
twenty-nine days.&nbsp; Owing to the precession of the stars,
Stonehenge no longer answered some of the purposes for which it
has been founded.&nbsp; The Greeks had adopted with ardour the
Metonic Cycle discovered by them <span
class="GutSmall">B.C.</span> 430, and they reformed the old Sun
Temple by the addition of the inner horseshoe of blue stones
which represented that Cycle, for they were in number
nineteen.&nbsp; As to how, or why, the blue stones came to be
imported, I imagine they are native to Brittany or Normandy,
whence they might easily have been brought as ballast in Greek
ships, which took back tin in their stead from Poole or
Christchurch, and from the latter port they might easily have
been taken in rafts to Amesbury.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE DATE OF STONEHENGE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> printing this second edition of
my little guide-book, I think it will be found interesting and
necessary to leave all the former evidence and opinions that I
collected as to the date of Stonehenge.&nbsp; Since the
excavations in 1901, I think we may consider the age of
Stonehenge to be between three and four thousand years.&nbsp; Mr.
W. Gowland judges from the implements or tools found, Sir Norman
Lockyer and Dr. Penrose from astronomical observations, based on
the fact that the avenue (&ldquo;Vi&acirc; Sacra&rdquo;) to
Stonehenge from the east of the ancients was in a line with the
Altar Stone, so that the sun, rising on the day of the solar
half-year (June 21st) and creeping over the horizon, shed his
beams on the Altar Stone, thus marking the solar half-year.&nbsp;
Of course, the east of the ancients is not our east, but the <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>difference
between the position of the sun <i>now</i> and then to the avenue
gives, according to these gentlemen&rsquo;s calculations, a date
of 3700 years old to Stonehenge.</p>
<h2>THE FINDS AT STONEHENGE, 1901.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> implements found during the
excavations made for the underpinning of the &ldquo;Leaning
Stone&rdquo; are thus classified by Mr. W. Gowland:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) Haches roughly chipped, longer and shorter.&nbsp; (2)
Axe-hammers.&nbsp; (3) Hammer-stones with blunt edge.&nbsp; The
above are of flint.&nbsp; (4) Regular hammer-stones of compact
sarsen.&nbsp; (5) Mauls of the same rock, weighing from 37 to 64
lbs. each.&nbsp; There were also found chippings from the
monoliths, and, near the surface, coins and animal bones.</p>
<p>Only one trace of copper or bronze occurred other than coins
and superficial finds, a mere strain on a block of sarsen.&nbsp;
So we may consider Stonehenge to belong to the late Neolithic, or
early Bronze Period.&nbsp; These objects have been lent by Sir
Edmund Antrobus to the museum at Devizes for a period of six
months.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In the January, 1902, number of <i>Man</i>, Mr. W.
Gowland&rsquo;s interesting paper will be found, describing the
excavations, methods of trimming and erecting the stones
practised by the ancients.</p>
<p>As to the kinds of stone actually employed in the building of
Stonehenge, the whole of the outer circle and the four stones
lying beyond that circle are undoubtedly &ldquo;Sarsen&rdquo;
(which are the boulder stones left by the ice-sheet of the
glacial period on the Wiltshire downs).&nbsp; There are, in the
inner circle, four stones which have been called
&ldquo;horn-stone.&rdquo;&nbsp; The remainder are
&ldquo;diabase,&rdquo; commonly called &ldquo;bluestones,&rdquo;
and similar are found in Wales, and in parts of Cumberland and
Cornwall, the so-called Altar Stone being a kind of grey
sandstone, not sarsen.&nbsp; The large outlying stone, known
traditionally as the &ldquo;Friar&rsquo;s Heel,&rdquo; from a
legend that when the devil was busy erecting Stonehenge he made
the observation that no one would ever know how it was
done.&nbsp; This was overheard by a friar <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>lurking near
by, and he incautiously replied in the Wiltshire dialect,
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more than thee can tell,&rdquo; and fled for
his life; the devil, catching up an odd stone, flung it after the
friar, and hit him on the heel.&nbsp; This stone is also named
the &ldquo;Pointer,&rdquo; because from the middle of the Altar
Stone the sun is seen at the summer solstice (21st of June) to
rise immediately above it.&nbsp; The Hele Stone is the true name,
&ldquo;Hele&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;to hide,&rdquo; from Heol or
Haul of Geol or Jul, all names for the sun, which this stone
seems to hide.&nbsp; From the Friar&rsquo;s Heel it is about 66
yards to a low circular earthen boundary, enclosing the area
within which Stonehenge stands.&nbsp; Just within the entrance to
this earthen ring lies a large prostrate stone called the
&ldquo;Slaughter Stone,&rdquo; supposed by some to have been used
for the slaughter of victims about to be offered in sacrifice at
the altar.&nbsp; The Slaughter Stone (at the end nearest to the
Friar&rsquo;s Heel) bears evidence of tool-marks, there being six
small round cavities made in it by blows from a flint tool.&nbsp;
On the margin of the earthen ring, one 55 yards on the left, the
other 95 yards on the right of the entrance, are two small,
unhewn stones.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Stonehenge stands about 440 feet above the sea-level.&nbsp;
The outer circle measures 308 feet in circumference, and is
supposed to have been formed originally of thirty upright stones,
seventeen of which are still standing, and the remains of nine
others are to be found fallen to the ground.&nbsp; These stones
formerly stood 14 feet above the surface of the ground, but now
are of different heights.&nbsp; Their breadth and thickness also
vary: the former averaging 7 feet, the latter 3&frac12;.&nbsp;
The stones were fixed in the ground at intervals of 3&frac12;
feet, connected at the top by a continuous line of thirty imposts
forming a corona or ring of stone at a height of 16 feet above
the ground, and were all squared and rough hewn, and cleverly
joined together.&nbsp; The uprights were cut with knobs or
tenons, which fitted into mortice holes hewn in the undersides of
the horizontal stones.&nbsp; About 9 feet within this peristyle
was the &ldquo;inner circle,&rdquo; composed of diabase obelisks;
within this, again, was the &ldquo;great ellipse,&rdquo; formed
of five, or, as some think, seven trilithons of stones, each
group consisting of two blocks placed upright and one
crosswise.&nbsp; These structures rose progressively in <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>height from
N.E. to S.W., and the loftiest and largest attained an elevation
of 25 feet.&nbsp; Lastly, within the trilithons was the
&ldquo;inner ellipse,&rdquo; consisting of nineteen obelisks of
diabase.&nbsp; Within the inner ellipse we find the Altar
Stone.&nbsp; At the present moment, there remains of the outer
circle or peristyle sixteen uprights and six imposts; of the
inner circle, seven only stand upright of the great
ellipse&mdash;there are still two perfect trilithons and two
single uprights.&nbsp; The Duke of Buckingham, in his researches
in 1620, is said to have caused the fall of a trilithon.&nbsp; He
was at Wilton in the reign of James I., and he &ldquo;did cause
the middle of Stonehenge to be digged, and under this digging was
the cause of the falling down or recumbency of the great stone
there, twenty-one foote long.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;In the process
of digging they found a great many horns of stags and oxen,
charcoal batter-dishes (?), heads of arrows, some pieces of
armour eaten out with rust, bones rotten, but whether of
stagge&rsquo;s or men they could not tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1797, on a rapid thaw succeeding a severe frost, another
trilithon fell; of the inner ellipse, there are six blocks in
their places; and in the centre remains the so-called Altar
Stone.</p>
<p>In Sir R. C. Hoare&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of Wiltshire,&rdquo;
he mentions that Inigo Jones observed a stone, which is now gone,
in the inmost part of the cell, appearing not much above the
surface of the earth and lying towards the east, four feet broad
and sixteen long, which was his supposed Altar Stone.&nbsp; Also
&ldquo;Philip, Earl of Pembroke (Lord Chamberlayne to King
Charles I.), did say &lsquo;that an altar stone was found in the
middle of the area here, and that it was carried away to St.
James&rsquo;s.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The entrance to Stonehenge faced the N.E., and the road to it,
&ldquo;Vi&acirc; Sacra,&rdquo; or avenue, can be traced by banks
of earth.</p>
<p>It is the opinion of competent authorities that many of the
stones should be underpinned in the manner of the &ldquo;Leaning
Stone,&rdquo; as any violent storms, such as periodically sweep
across the Plain, might bring them down.&nbsp; The fall of two of
the stones from the outer circle (supposed by the superstitious
to foretell the Queen&rsquo;s death) on December 31st, 1900, the
last day of the old century, and 103 years <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>after the
last stones fell, was caused by a gale from the west.</p>
<p>There are the two opinions as to the right course to pursue
regarding Stonehenge&mdash;some people considering it would be
well to leave it to fall down, so that eventually it would appear
like a jumbled heap of ninepins, others (myself among the number)
that the necessary steps for its Preservation, <i>not</i>
Restoration, should be taken.</p>

<p>The question arises whether there were formerly other stones
belonging to the earth circle.&nbsp; From probing the ground,
there is reason to believe that a stone on this bank may once
have marked the direction of the axis.</p>
<h2>SARSEN CIRCLE.</h2>
<p>17 piers <i>in situ</i>, 8 prostrate or fragments, 5
missing.</p>
<p>6 lintels <i>in situ</i>, 2 fragments, 20 missing.</p>
<h2>BLUESTONE CIRCLE.</h2>
<p>12 stones or stumps <i>in situ</i>, 10 prostrate, 4
missing.</p>
<h2><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>SARSEN
TRILITHONS.</h2>
<p>5 piers <i>in situ</i>, 3 prostrate, 5 missing.</p>
<p>From this list of missing blue stones we may safely deduct
two; two pieces of rock are known to be beneath the turf, and
there may be others.&nbsp; The most satisfactory derivation of
Sarsens or Sassens is from the Anglo-Saxon word for a rock or
stone&mdash;<i>ses</i>, plural <i>sesen</i> or
<i>sesons</i>.&nbsp; The Inner Circle of blue stones and Inner
Horse-shoe are composed of the &ldquo;Blue Stones,&rdquo; igneous
rocks.</p>
<h2>DERIVATION OF AMESBURY.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;On Salisbury Plain stand the ruins of the weird Circle
of Revolution, Cor y Coeth in Welsh, the Circle of Dominion, the
holy anointed stones of Ambresbiri (<i>ambree</i>, anointed;
<i>biri</i>, Hebrew for holy ones), at once a sanctuary and a
sundial (3000 years ago the only clock in Britain), regulated by
the sun and moon for days and years.&nbsp; But the beautiful old
British names since the sixth century have been blotted out by
the terrible title <i>Stonehenge</i> or stone
gallows&mdash;Stanhengen in Anglo-Saxon.&nbsp; A permanent
gallows of stone was used by the Saxons for the execution of
criminals, and wishing to aim a death-blow at British power, no
surer way was found by the invaders than by hanging British
leaders upon the consecrated stones of their revered
temple.&nbsp; The road from the village of Amesbury to the Circle
is still called Gallow&rsquo;s Hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>From Mrs. Gordon&rsquo;s
Pamphlet</i>.</p>
<h2>DERIVATION OF DRUID.</h2>
<p>An Arabic (and Persian) word meaning Holy Men come from the
valley of the Euphrates.&nbsp; Mrs. Gordon considers Merlin (the
Bismarck of his age) as the builder of Stonehenge; also that
Aurelius Ambrosius, by his own wish, was buried within the Circle
of Stonehenge.</p>
<h2><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>DERIVATION OF BARROWS.</h2>
<p>Barrow, a Hebrew word for grave Mounds.&nbsp; Literally, the
&ldquo;thrown-up pit of lamentation.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>DERIVATION OF WILTSHIRE.</h2>
<p>Wiltshire, in the Saxon Chronicles Wiltunseir, in Doomesday
Wiltescire, derives its name from the town of Wilton, from the
Wit-saetas (<i>saetan</i> = settlers or inhabitants), the West
Saxon tribe who made it their home.</p>
<h2>MENTION OF AMESBURY IN MALORY&rsquo;S &ldquo;MORTE
D&rsquo;ARTHUR.&rdquo;</h2>
<p>&ldquo;And thus upon a night there came a vision unto Sir
Launcelot, and charged him, in remission of all his sins, to
haste him towards Almesbury.&nbsp; &lsquo;And by that time thou
come, there thou shalt find Queen Guenever dead; and therefore
take thy fellows with thee, and also purvey thee a horse bier,
and bring you the corpse of her, and bury it by her lord and
husband.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then Sir Launcelot took his seven fellows
with him, and on foot they went from Glastonbury, which is little
more than thirty miles.&nbsp; And when Sir Launcelot was come to
Almesbury, within the nunnery, Queen Guenever died but half an
hour before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Timbs, in his &ldquo;Abbeys and Castles in England,&rdquo;
says: &ldquo;At Amesbury, says Bishop Tanner, quoting from
Geoffrey of Monmouth, there is said to have been an ancient
British monastery for 300 monks, founded, as some say, by the
famous Prince Ambrosius who lived at the time of the Saxon
invasion, and who was therein buried, destroyed by that cruel
pagan, Gurmendus, who overran all this country in the sixth
century.&rdquo;&nbsp; This alludes to a monastery prior to the
one founded by Elfrida, with which I begin my account of Amesbury
Abbey.</p>
<h2><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>THE
AVENUE OR VI&Acirc; SACRA</h2>
<p>is orientated to the midsummer sunrise, and points 50&deg;
east of north point.&nbsp; It leads uninterruptedly to the
circular space formed by the earth circle in which Stonehenge
stands, the enclosing bank being discontinued in this
direction.&nbsp; It is noteworthy that the sun stone, as well as
the slaughter stone, are not placed in the centre of the avenue
or approach, but lie towards the eastern side of it.&nbsp; The
avenue is made by two parallel lines confining ditches, the earth
having been thrown inwards so as to slightly raise the
roadway.&nbsp; These ditches, though shallow, are distinct.&nbsp;
The avenue thus formed descends the gradual incline of the Down,
until at about one thousand five hundred feet from the sun stone
the ditches become indistinguishable.&nbsp; Here the descent is
more rapid and leads to a gentle valley in the Down, where the
avenue divided into two branches.&nbsp; It is now impossible to
trace this point of division with any certainty.</p>
<h2>THE CURSUS AVENUE.</h2>
<p>This is now completely obliterated.</p>
<h2>THE LONG AVENUE.</h2>
<p>The branch which turned to the right, forming the eastern
slope of the valley, went over its crest and continued in a
straight line in the direction of some high land to the north of
Vespasian&rsquo;s Camp.&nbsp; The plough at work year after year
has completely effaced all traces of this avenue, and we have to
rely on Dr. Stukeley&rsquo;s account written 150 years ago.</p>
<h2>THE PARALLEL BANK.</h2>
<p>At 1200 feet from the sun stone &ldquo;the approach&rdquo; is
intersected at an angle approximating roughly to a right angle by
parallel banks about two feet in height and forty feet <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>apart; the
roadway thus formed continues about 600 feet to left and right;
to the east it is continued by a causeway across the valley
already spoken of, and it is used by carts passing that way,
required in the cultivation of fields to the west of the
avenue.</p>
<h2>THE CURSUS.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Discovered by Dr. Stukeley</i>,
1723.</p>
<p>This great enclosure lies to the north of Stonehenge, and
veers 6&deg; from due east and west.&nbsp; Like the avenue it is
formed by banks thrown up from an outer ditch.&nbsp; It is 9000
feet in length, with a width of 350 feet at its centre, but
towards its extremities it narrows.&nbsp; To the west, the
southern boundary is irregular.&nbsp; The northern ditch, on the
contrary, makes a fairly straight line.&nbsp; Its eastern end is
headed by a long mound now difficult to trace.&nbsp; Near its
western extremity, and within the enclosure, are two small tumuli
irregularly placed.&nbsp; The greater part of this earthwork
being on the uncultivated Down is fairly well defined, especially
to the west; to the east it has been obliterated by the
plough.</p>
<h2>THE LESSER CURSUS.</h2>
<p>To the north-west of the Great Cursus and over 7000 feet
distant from Stonehenge, is an earthwork apparently the beginning
of a second cursus.&nbsp; It is ill defined, and at 1200 feet
from its enclosed end the ditches cease.&nbsp; It appears to be
an abandoned scheme for an enclosure similar to the Cursus.</p>
<p>From &ldquo;Stonehenge,&rdquo; Mr. Edgar Barclay.&nbsp; At
page 66 he says:&mdash;&ldquo;The Cursus is irregular in shape,
nevertheless there remains a very strong probability that it is
an adjunct of Stonehenge, and was designed with it, and is not an
independent earthwork as Sir R. Colt Hoare maintains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From Mr. J. F. Hewitt&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ruling Races of
Pre-historic Times&rdquo;:&mdash;&ldquo;A hippodrome can still be
traced about half a mile north of the Temple, with which it is
connected by an <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>avenue about forty cubits wide.&nbsp; This is divided
into two branches, about 1700 feet from the Temple, the eastern
hand going eastward to Radfin, a ford on the Avon, and the
western curving round to the ancient chariot-course.&nbsp; It was
here the seasonal games took place, said by Macrobius to have
been celebrated by the Druids, when sacrifices were offered to
the gods.&nbsp; This ancient <i>campus martius</i>, running east
and west, is about 10,000 feet or 6000 Druidical cubits long, and
350 feet or 200 Druidical cubits wide, and on the east side is a
long bank, extending nearly its whole length, which must have
served as a place for spectators; while on the west side is a
curve to allow for the turning of the competing chariots.&nbsp;
There can be no doubt whatever that this racecourse represents
the ancient site of the national games; instituted by the Sons of
the Horse, which are said in Greek tradition to have been founded
by Akastus, king of Iolcus, after he had driven out Jason and
Medea the sorceress.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>EARTHWORKS ON SALISBURY PLAIN.</h2>
<p>Tumuli, or Barrows, are the most simple kind of sepulchral
monument; they consist of a mound of earth or stones raised over
the dead.</p>
<p>Sir Richard Colt Hoare thus classifies them in his
&ldquo;History of Wiltshire&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The Long Barrow.&nbsp; Differing considerably in
their construction.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The Bowl Barrow.&nbsp; The most ordinary shape.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The Bell Barrow.&nbsp; This, from the elegance of its
form, seems a refinement on the Bowl Barrow.&nbsp; They abound
near Stonehenge.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Druid Barrow (1st class).&nbsp; I consider these
tumuli were appropriated to the female tribes.&nbsp; The outward
vallum with the ditch within is beautifully moulded, and in most
instances found to contain small cups, small lance heads, amber,
jet, and glass beads.</p>
<p><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>5.&nbsp; Druid Barrow (2nd class).&nbsp; In external
form these resemble the preceding, but their circumference is not
so large.&nbsp; The tumulus within rises to a point from the edge
of the vallum.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Pond Barrow.&nbsp; They differ totally from all
others, and resemble an excavation made for a pond.&nbsp; I can
form no conjecture as to their use.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Twin Barrow.&nbsp; They are not very common, and, by
being enclosed in a circle, seem to denote the interment of
relations.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; Cone Barrow.&nbsp; The only one I have seen is at
Everley.&nbsp; The tumulus rises immediately from the ditch, and
the apex is higher and more pointed.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; Broad Barrow.&nbsp; Resembles the Bowl Barrow, but is
higher and flatter at the top.</p>
<p>Mr. Edgar Barclay, in &ldquo;Stonehenge,&rdquo;
says:&mdash;&ldquo;The presence of barrows (near Stonehenge)
would enable marriages to be celebrated on the spot.&nbsp; A
feast at the family tomb was an opportunity for a young woman
about to marry to be formally introduced to the domestic worship
of the family she was about to enter.&nbsp; That feasts did occur
at Stonehenge Barrows we have proofs.&nbsp; We find also that
Irish Fairs in honour of the Sun God were held in proximity to
extensive burial-places.&nbsp; The arrangement of the avenues,
the placing of the cursus, the placing of the sun stone and
slaughter stone, the break in the lintel circle, &amp;c.: these
characteristics point out to us the probable procedures at times
of festival.&nbsp; The midsummer festival solemnized the holy
espousals of the Sun God with the land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In &ldquo;The Ruling Races of Pre-historic Times,&rdquo; Mr.
Hewitt says:&mdash;&ldquo;The deer worshippers were the mixed
race formed from the union of the sons of the mother-tree, the
mother-bear and wolf, the lordly boar and the prolific sow, the
mother-cow, the mother-mountain, and father firestone, the people
who looked on the Sun God of the equinoxes and solstices as the
god who made their crops to grow and who ripened their barley,
the seed of life (<i>zi</i>), the Zeus of the Greeks, which gave
its name to the Deus of the Latins and the Theos of the Greeks,
the Manx god Ji.&nbsp; This father sun <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>god was the god on the grey white
horse, the clouds, the white horse in Zend mythology of Tishtrya,
the star of the summer solstice which succeeded the golden horned
bull of the bull race, as the adversary and conqueror of the
black horse, and the black bull or dragon, the cloud which will
not give up its rain, which was in Northern mythology the winter
frost giant.&nbsp; It was this white horse&mdash;the sun god of
the limestone, flint, and chalk country&mdash;which was the god
of Stonehenge, the temple whose ruins still remain to set before
us, with absolute certainty of the correctness of the deduction
in its main details, the complete ritual of this prim&aelig;val
worship.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Note</i>.&mdash;The white sun horse is still worshipped and
fed daily at Kobe, in Japan.</p>
<p>The worshippers of the sun god who built this temple are
proved to have belonged to the Bronze age by the number of round
barrow tombs within twelve miles of it; and Stukeley (<span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1723) counted one hundred and
twenty-eight as visible from a hill close by.</p>
<h2>VESPASIAN&rsquo;S CAMP.</h2>
<p>A name given by Dr. Stukeley to the (probably) British
earthworks, locally known as &ldquo;the Ramparts,&rdquo; which
crown a hill in the demesne of Amesbury Abbey.&nbsp; Its ancient
lines of defence, enclosing thirty-nine acres and boldly scarped
towards the west, environ the summit in the form of a scalene
triangle.&nbsp; This hill is densely wooded, containing two
beautiful avenues of beech-trees, and as it descends to the Avon,
is cut into a fanciful shape, supposed to resemble a
diamond.&nbsp; I have described this in &ldquo;Amesbury
Abbey.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>WEST AMESBURY HOUSE.</h2>
<p>A pretty old house on the road-side, belonging to Sir Edmund
Antrobus, built of stone and flint.&nbsp; The interior has been
much altered and spoilt.&nbsp; Traces of a monastic building
exist in the beams supporting the roof, and in a church doorway
at the top of the staircase.&nbsp; These date <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>from the
fifteenth century.&nbsp; Aubrey informs us that this house and
property, along with Stonehenge, once formed the dowry of the
wife of Lord Ferrers of Chartley.&nbsp; The village of West
Amesbury possesses some picturesque thatched cottages, and on an
outside wall of one is a rude sketch of fighting cocks and their
backers.</p>
<h2>WILSFORD HOUSE.</h2>
<p>A house on the banks of the Avon, built by the late Mr. Loder,
of Salisbury, two miles from Amesbury.&nbsp; It is of the modern
&ldquo;villa&rdquo; description.&nbsp; In 1898 Mr. Young
purchased it from Sir E. Loder, and re-sold it to Mr. Edward
Tennant in 1900.&nbsp; None of the places described along the
Avon Valley are open to the public, but they can be seen from the
high road.</p>

</a></p>
<h2>LAKE HOUSE,</h2>
<p>situated on the banks of the Avon, is in the parish of
Wilsford, and about three miles south of Amesbury.&nbsp; The
exact date of its foundation is uncertain.&nbsp; Its main
features are Elizabethan, but an old letter in the possession of
the family clearly suggests an earlier date.&nbsp; &ldquo;As to
ye date of ye house,&rdquo; says the correspondent, &ldquo;I do
not remember anything in that beautifully written deed to which
you refer that would bear on it.&nbsp; Great weight would belong
to any opinion expressed by ye late J. H. Parker, and you told me
that you thought it might be as early as Edward VI. or earlier,
and probably Parker judged only by what he saw, and ye
architectural features that remain have in them nothing
distinctive in comparison with those what have
vanished.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lake House is one of the most beautiful in
this neighbourhood, and is built of the usual stone and flint; it
possesses yew hedges and delightful old-fashioned gardens sloping
to the river.&nbsp; It was purchased in 1591 by George Duke, and
it remained in the Duke family till 1897, when (just in time to
save the old house from utter ruin) it was bought by Mr. J. N.
Lovibond, and most beautifully restored by the <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>architect,
Mr. Detmar Blow, according to the views of the Society for the
Protection of Ancient Buildings.&nbsp; There are barrows in the
park at Lake, and many curious objects, such as amber necklaces,
&amp;c., were discovered in them about fifty years ago during
excavations made by the late Mr. Duke.&nbsp; Some of the things
then found are in the British Museum.&nbsp; A cottage industry is
now carried on in the village of Lake: a sort of rough tweed in
pretty colours being made in hand looms by the women.&nbsp; This
tweed is called &ldquo;Stonehenge&rdquo; cloth, and is not
expensive.</p>
<h2>GREAT DURNFORD CHURCH.</h2>
<p>Leaving Amesbury, and following the eastern banks of the Avon,
we come to Great Durnford.&nbsp; Its name is derived from the
British word &ldquo;dur,&rdquo; signifying water.&nbsp; The
church is most picturesque, and is built of stone and flint, with
very rich Norman north and south doorways and chancel arch.&nbsp;
The font is Norman, with an interesting arcade.&nbsp; The pulpit
is of oak and dated 1619, and has a very old velvet cover with
1657 worked on it.&nbsp; Built into the wall of the church is a
stone coffin containing a skeleton, supposed to be that of the
founder.&nbsp; Traces of two doors leading to the rood loft can
still be seen, and in one window are the remains of some very old
glass.&nbsp; Inside the south door are several curious crosses,
supposed to be dedication crosses.&nbsp; In the chancel is a
leper&rsquo;s window.&nbsp; The altar rails are of oak, and date
back to the sixteenth century.&nbsp; The pattern on the walls is
the same as that found some years ago under the plaster and
whitewash.&nbsp; There is a curious brass to the memory of Edward
Young, his wife, and fourteen children, dated 1670.&nbsp; In the
chancel, chained to an ancient desk, is a copy of Jewel&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Apologie of the Church of England,&rdquo; ordered by
Convocation after the Reformation, 1571.</p>
<h2>GREAT DURNFORD HOUSE</h2>
<p>was once a seat of the Hungerfords.&nbsp; Evelyn notes in his
Diary, July, 1654:&mdash;&ldquo;We dined at a ferme of my Uncle
<a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>Hungerford&rsquo;s called Darneforde magna, situate in a
valley under the plaine, most sweetly watered, abounding in
troutes, catched by speares in the night when they come attracted
by a light set in ye sterne of a boate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is in the French ch&acirc;teau style on a small scale, and
has lovely old-fashioned gardens, quite unspoiled, with some rare
trees growing in them.&nbsp; At the end of the last garden flows
the Avon, and picturesque Durnford Church stands close by.&nbsp;
In 1869 Mr. Pinckney bought the house and some of the estate from
the Earl of Malmesbury.</p>
<h2>OGBURY CAMP.</h2>
<p>On the eastern side of the Avon is a very ancient earthen work
called Ogbury Camp.&nbsp; Sir Richard Colt Hoare thus describes
it:&mdash;&ldquo;On this hill we recognize the very early and
simple handiwork of the Britons, unaltered by their successors
and conquerors, the Romans and Saxons.&nbsp; Here we see a large
tract of sixty-two acres enclosed within a single rampart, and
without any fosse to strengthen it against the attacks of an
enemy, and we perceive within the area the evident marks of
enclosures, and only one entrance to the east.&nbsp; On the
northern side the ramparts followed the windings of the hill, and
are interrupted by the plantations of Lord Malmesbury&rsquo;s
demesne.&nbsp; The area contains sixty-two acres and a
quarter.&nbsp; The circuit of the outer ditch is one mile, one
furlong and fifty-five yards, and the depth of the vallum is
thirty-three feet.&nbsp; On the south-east and west sides the
ramparts are very much mutilated.&nbsp; I cannot consider Ogbury
as a camp or work of defence against an invading enemy, but
rather as an asylum or place of refuge, whither the Britons, in
times of danger, retired with their families and herds of
cattle.&nbsp; On digging within this area we could not find any
marks of ancient residence, but on some high ground adjoining the
extraordinary verdure of the turf induced us to dig into the
soil, where we immediately found numerous bones of animals with
fragments of the rudest British pottery.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>HEALE
HOUSE, MIDDLE WOODFORD.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>The Residence of the Honourable
Louis Greville</i>; <i>bought by him from Sir E. Loder</i>,
1894.</p>
<p>This house, beautifully built of small red bricks, has
stone-coped windows in the Dutch style of architecture introduced
into this country by William III., and is quite unlike the usual
stone and flint &ldquo;chequered&rdquo; houses of the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; You enter the grounds through old
wrought-iron gates and down an avenue of elm-trees.&nbsp; The
river Avon flows through the garden.&nbsp; This property formerly
belonged to the Errington and Hyde families.&nbsp; Inside the
house little remains of the old decorations but some carved
woodwork.&nbsp; A cupboard in a bedroom is shown as the
hiding-place of Charles II. after the battle of Worcester.&nbsp;
He is said to have visited Stonehenge from Heale, and there met
friends who were to conduct him to the coast of Sussex prior to
his escape from England.&nbsp; He is supposed to have proved to
his own satisfaction the fallacy of the notion of the
impossibility of counting the stones composing Stonehenge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1721 Robert Hyde bequeathed Heale to his sister,
Mrs. Levinz, widow of the Bishop of Sodor and Man, and she, by
will, devised the estates to her son-in-law, Michael Frampton of
Oxford, and he, in his turn, left them to his nephews, Thomas
Bull, rector of Porton, and Edward and Simon Polhill and their
heirs in succession, in default thereof to William Bowles; in
seventeen years after the death of the testator, Canon Bowles was
in full possession of the property.&rdquo;&nbsp; Several members
of the Bowles family lie buried in Salisbury Cathedral.&nbsp;
Heale Hill is remarkable for a circle on the summit and traces of
a British village on the south slope.</p>

43</span>APPENDIX.<br />
THE RECENT WORK AT STONEHENGE. <a name="citation43"></a><a
href="#footnote43" class="citation">[43]</a></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> a meeting held last March at
Stonehenge, and attended by representatives of the Society of
Antiquaries, of the Society for the Protection of Ancient
Monuments, and the Wiltshire Arch&aelig;ological Society, various
plans and measures were discussed and suggested for the better
preservation of Stonehenge.&nbsp; The whole state of the
surrounding neighbourhood being changed from its former quietude
by the introduction of new elements, such as the military camps
at Bulford, &amp;c., the making of the new branch line of the
South-Western Railway (from Grateley to Amesbury), it became
necessary to meet the altered circumstances by the exercise of
greater precautions for the care of the beautiful old Sun Temple
standing in the midst of the grass-clothed downs&mdash;a thing of
wonder and mystery to behold.&nbsp; The advice given to Sir
Edmund Antrobus by the representatives of these societies was as
follows, published in the <i>Times</i> of April 3:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Resolutions</i>.</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp; That this Committee approves of the suggested
protection of Stonehenge by a wire fence not less than 4 ft.
high, following on two sides the existing roads and crossing on
the west from the 331-foot level on the north road to the
332-foot level on the south road shown on the O.S. map (1-2,
500), Wilts sheet liv. 14.</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp; That the Committee recommends, without prejudice to
any legal question, that the local authorities be requested to
agree to divert the existing track-way or ridge-way from
Netheravon now passing through the earth circle so as to pass
from the 302-foot levels in the O.S. map immediately west of
Stonehenge.</p>
<p><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>(3)&nbsp; That stones 6 and 7 with their lintel, and
stone 56 (according to the numbering on Mr. Petrie&rsquo;s plan)
be first examined, with a view of maintaining them in a position
of safety.</p>
<p>(4)&nbsp; That, in the opinion of this Committee, stone 22
should be replaced, stone 21 be made safe, and the lintel of 21
and 22 be replaced in the most safe and conservative
manner.&nbsp; The Committee also recommends the re-erection of
stones 57 and 58, and their lintel 158.</p>
<p>(5)&nbsp; That the instructions to custodians already in force
be approved with a few suggested alterations.</p>
<p>(6)&nbsp; That this Committee feels that it is impossible to
overstate the value of the assistance which the County Council of
Amesbury can give to the efforts made to preserve this unique
monument.</p>
<p>(7)&nbsp; That these resolutions be sent to Sir Edmund
Antrobus with the earnest thanks of the Committee, for the part
he is proposing to take in the preservation of Stonehenge, also
that it be left to him to communicate with the Press.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The fence was erected by Whitsuntide, and is 1700 yards in
circumference, and composed of lightest barbed wire of a neutral
tint, and absolutely invisible at a distance, so that the
traveller gets the whole effect of Stonehenge in its full
grandeur instead of, as in former days, the view of the stones
mingled with two or three flys, a cart, an old waggonette, and
photographer&rsquo;s van, &amp;c., to say nothing of picnic
luncheons, spread out within the sacred circle.&nbsp; This fence
encloses as large an area as possible, being well outside the
vallum, except on the west side, where a right of way interferes
with the true circle.&nbsp; The next work undertaken&mdash;the
most difficult and important of the whole&mdash;was the raising
of the &ldquo;leaning stone&rdquo;&mdash;the largest monolith in
England except Cleopatra&rsquo;s needle&mdash;to an upright
position.&nbsp; This stone formed one of the uprights of the
trilithon, the fall of which was said to have been caused by the
digging and researches of the Duke of Buckingham in 1620.&nbsp;
The horizontal and the other upright (the latter broken in two
pieces) now lie prostrate across the altar stone.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

"The work at Stonehenge.  Raising the Leaning Stone"
title=
"The work at Stonehenge.  Raising the Leaning Stone"
 src="images/p44s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The great stone leaned considerably towards the N.E. <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>and appeared
to rest upon (actually touching at one point) a beautiful little
pillar stone of syenite, the danger being that in some storm,
especially after a heavy fall of snow and sudden thaw, the great
stone would break in three pieces (having three veins) in
falling, and also crush the smaller stone beneath it.</p>
<p>That a forward movement was continually taking place is shown
by observations taken by Mr. Flinders Petrie some years
ago.&nbsp; It then leaned at an angle of 66, which has been
increased to one of 60.5 degrees lately.&nbsp; The work of the
raising of the stone was begun on August 18th and finished
September 25th, and was under the direct supervision of Mr.
Gowland, Mr. Detmar Blow, architect, and his assistant Mr.
Stallybrass, and Mr. Carruthers, engineer.&nbsp; The first thing
done was to make a fitting to the stone of a strong timber
cradle, so as to protect it from injury by the immense iron
chains and ropes placed round it, these being attached to winches
worked by men, so that the stone was actually &ldquo;wound
up,&rdquo; so to speak, into an upright position.&nbsp; Hydraulic
jacks were also used.&nbsp; The whole thing was most carefully
and slowly done, and devotedly watched over by the workers.&nbsp;
A rectangular excavation was made in front of the stone, a square
excavation at the back.&nbsp; A frame of wood with numbers at
equal distances apart was placed over the ground, which was
excavated in sections, and the earth was most carefully sifted in
layers through four grades of sieves in such a manner that the
position of every object found could be recorded.&nbsp; The
excavations round the base of the stone are now filled with
concrete, and the large struts which uphold it will remain in
their positions for six months, until the concrete be thoroughly
set.</p>
<p>The objects found were one Roman coin and one George III.
penny at a shallow depth, and many chippings of both the blue and
sarsen stones.&nbsp; Numerous flint axe-heads and large stone
hammers were also found at a depth of from two feet to four feet
six inches underground; all tending to prove the great antiquity
of Stonehenge&mdash;at least Neolithic.&nbsp; But all this will
be discussed scientifically later on.</p>

Fields in the County of London Solicitors for the Plaintiffs.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; On Stonehenge Down in the Parish of Amesbury in the
County of Wilts there are a group of stones and surrounding
earthworks which are together known as Stonehenge.&nbsp; <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>Stonehenge
which is of very great antiquity originally formed an ancient
building and place of assembly for public worship the burial of
the dead deliberation on public affairs or other public purposes
and since it has ceased to be so used has remained a national
monument and place of resort of great public interest.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Until the acts of the Defendant hereinafter
complained of there was and there now ought to be free access for
the public to Stonehenge by means of roads running up to and
through the same the sites of which roads are shown on the plan
hereunto annexed and are thereon coloured green.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The said roads were at the time of the said acts and
are public highways for all His Majesty&rsquo;s liege subjects to
go and return on foot and with horses and carriages at all times
of the year at their free will and pleasure.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Stonehenge is subject to a trust created by a grant
or declaration of trust which if in writing has been lost or by a
Statute which has been lost for the free user by the public of
Stonehenge as a place of resort and for the free access of the
public thereto by means of the said roads and the site of
Stonehenge has since the creation of such trust been held by the
owners thereof for the time being subject to the said trust.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; The Defendant has lately erected and maintains and

<h4>DEFENCE.</h4>
<p>1.&nbsp; As to paragraph 1 of the Statement of Claim it is not
admitted that Stonehenge was made or ever used for such purposes
as in the said paragraph mentioned or any of them or for any
public purpose.&nbsp; Stonehenge is and has been from time
immemorial and in fact at all times private property and not
national or public property and resort thereto by the public has
always been by permission of the owner of the land and not as of
right.</p>
<p><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>2.&nbsp; As to paragraph 2 the principal part of
Stonehenge lies in an angle between and near to two public roads
leading from Amesbury to Shrewton and to Winterbourne Stoke
respectively.&nbsp; A public way or track leading from Netheravon
to Lake crosses these two roads and also crosses part of
Stonehenge but except the right to use this way or track (which
is outside the fence erected by the Defendant and has not been in
any way obstructed by him) there never has been any access for
the public to Stonehenge otherwise than by permission of the
owner of the land on which it is situate.&nbsp; The alleged road
running up to and through Stonehenge the sites of which are
purported to be shown on the plan annexed to the Statement of
Claim and are thereon coloured green (except the way or track
from Netheravon to Lake aforesaid) do not exist either in law or
in fact and never have existed.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Paragraph 3 of the Statement of Claim is denied
except as to the way or track from Netheravon to Lake
aforesaid.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Paragraph 4 is altogether denied.&nbsp; Stonehenge is
not and never was subject to any trust for user or access by the
public or to any public trust.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; As to paragraphs 5 and 6 the Defendant has for the
better preservation of Stonehenge erected and maintains a fence
round the land lying within the triangle formed by the said two
public roads and the way or track from Netheravon to Lake not
obstructing or interfering with any public right of way.&nbsp;
Save as aforesaid paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Statement of Claim
are denied.</p>

case commenced in the High Court of Justice, Chancery Division,
on Tuesday, March 28th, and continued on the 29th and 30th.&nbsp;
Again on the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 11th and 12th of April.&nbsp; Mr.
Justice Farwell delivered his considered judgment on the 19th,
concluding as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hold, therefore, that the access to the circle was
incident only to the permission to visit and inspect the stones,
and was, therefore, permissive only, and, further that the tracks
to the circle are not thoroughfares, but lead only to the circle,
where the public have no right without permission, and,
therefore, are not public ways.&nbsp; The action accordingly
fails, and ought never to have been brought.&nbsp; It is plain
that the vicinity of the camp and the consequent increase of
visitors compelled the defendant to protect the stones if they
were to be preserved; and he has done nothing more than is
necessary for such protection.&nbsp; I desire to give the
relators credit for wishing only to preserve this unique relic of
a former age for the benefit of the public, but I fail to
appreciate their method of attaining this.&nbsp; The first claim
to dispossess the defendant of his property is simply
extravagant, so much so that, although not technically abandoned,
no serious argument was addressed to me in support of it.&nbsp;
The rest of the claim&mdash;for rights of way over the network of
tracks shown on the plaintiffs&rsquo; plan&mdash;if successful
would defeat the relators&rsquo; object.&nbsp; If these ways were
left unfenced and heavy traffic passed through the circle, there
would be great risk of injury, and even without such traffic
there is great risk from the increased numbers of
passers-by.&nbsp; As Sir Norman Lockyer (whose interesting
application of the Orientation theory to Stonehenge has recently
appeared) says in one of his articles:&mdash;&lsquo;The real
destructive agent has been man himself&mdash;savages could not
have played more havoc with the monument than the English who
have visited it at different times for different
purposes.&rsquo;&nbsp; I feel no confidence that the majority of
tourists have improved, nay, rather,&mdash;&lsquo;Aetas parentum,
pejor avis, tulit Nos nequiores.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is only fair to
the defendant to say that he is not acting capriciously but on
expert advice for the preservation of the stones.&nbsp; If, on
the other hand, the roads are all fenced off, the general
appearance would be ruined, and no human being would be in any
way the better.&nbsp; It is not immaterial <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>to remark
that this is not the action of the District or the County Council
to preserve rights of way, but is brought on the relation of
strangers on the score of the public interest in
Stonehenge.&nbsp; The action is dismissed with costs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Warmington:&mdash;&ldquo;My Lord, there is only one matter
with regard to costs I think, and that is the question of the
Commission. <a name="citation52"></a><a href="#footnote52"
class="citation">[52]</a>&nbsp; My Lord, those were reserved, and
they will be costs in the action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Farwell:&mdash;&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; I may say
this&mdash;it sometimes saves trouble, and it is not unusual, I
have done it before, and I think I may say it now&mdash;that this
is a case in which the taxing master should allow three
counsel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Warmington:&mdash;&ldquo;If your Lordship pleases.&nbsp; I
was instructed to apply; but according to the practice it is done
after taxation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Farwell:&mdash;&ldquo;I know it is.&nbsp; But I
have done it before.&nbsp; You see the matter is now fresh in my
recollection, and a summons to vary might come before other
Judges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Warmington:&mdash;&ldquo;If your Lordship
pleases.&rdquo;</p>

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
